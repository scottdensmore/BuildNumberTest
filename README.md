Build Number Tests
------------------

Based on my [blog post](http://www.scottdensmore.com/blog/2013/01/build-numbers-tags-releases-oh-my.html)

A simple test project to show how to increment build numbers. It is based on the following blog post:

* [Revisiting git tags and building](http://www.cimgf.com/2011/02/20/revisiting-git-tags-and-building/)

You can use the scripts and make the changes to your app to make it work. It works best if you use the git workflow outlined [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

Make sure to chmod on the to .sh file.

* chmod -x tag.sh
