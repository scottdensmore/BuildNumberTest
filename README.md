Build Number Tests
------------------

A simple test project to show how to increment build numbers. It is based on the following blog posts:

* [From Hacker to microISV: Tagging, Building and Releasing](http://www.cimgf.com/2009/07/06/from-hacker-to-microisv-tagging-building-and-releasing/)
* [Revisiting git tags and building](http://www.cimgf.com/2011/02/20/revisiting-git-tags-and-building/)

You can use the scripts and make the changes to your app to make it work. It works best if you use the git workflow outlined [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

Make sure to chmod on the to .sh files.

* chmod -x build.sh
* chmod -x tag.sh
